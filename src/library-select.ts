 * local library that Engine DJ creates on install, with no way to ask for
 * the other one. Track count is the one signal available at discovery time
 * that actually tracks "the library this person works in".
 *
 * Ties break on root-scan order, so the choice is deterministic rather than
 * dependent on Map or filesystem iteration order. `trackCount` is null only
 * when the Track table could not be read at all (a 1.x library); such a
 * library is never `supported`, but treat null as "fewer than zero tracks"
 * anyway so a known count always beats an unknown one.
 *
 * Falls back to the first library of any kind -- including an unsupported
 * one -- so that ensureFresh's specific, actionable `unsupported_schema`
 * reaches the caller instead of the generic `library_not_found` that "no
 * supported library" would otherwise collapse into.
