   * one of the two is the drive the DJ performs from; root-scan order is not
   * a reason to pick it. Measured 2026-09-01: the computer's library and the
   * USB drive both held 257 tracks, tied precisely because one was a copy of

   * A named library is taken as named -- unless the name is a uuid two

   * drive copies its uuid, and resolving that uuid to the first match is the

   * no way to know it was ambiguous. namedWriteLibrary refuses it; a path
   * always names one.
   *
   * Rescans first, in both cases, because `knownList()` is a cache that
   * deliberately keeps a library a later scan cannot see -- so a momentarily
   * locked drive does not vanish from list_libraries. For a tie check that is
   * wrong in the direction that bites: pull the USB drive and one library is
   * left, but the cache still holds two, and the write is refused naming a
   * drive that is no longer there. rescanLibraries() forgets a candidate
   * whose path is gone, which is exactly the distinction wanted here, and it
   * also lets a drive plugged in mid-session be seen at all -- including a
   * copy that makes a named uuid ambiguous.
   *
   * The cost is one filesystem probe per write, against a write that is about
   * to copy the entire database for its pre-write snapshot. Reads are left

const SCHEMA_NOTE = `# Engine DJ library — schema and semantics

Tables live in \`m.db\` (attached as \`main\`); the search index lives in \`side\`.

## Choosing a library
More than one library can be connected at once — the local one under
\`~/Music\` and one per USB drive. \`list_libraries\` reports each with a
\`uuid\` and a \`path\`, and every tool that reads library data
(\`search_tracks\`, \`get_tracks\`, \`get_playlists\`,
\`get_playlist_tracks\`, \`get_track_performance\`, \`audit_library\`,
\`run_sql\`, \`refresh_index\`) takes an optional
\`library\` argument naming one of them — as does \`create_playlist\`, when
the server was started with \`--allow-writes\` — either the \`uuid\` or the
\`path\`, in the \`~/...\` form \`list_libraries\` prints or the absolute
one. A value matching neither comes back as \`library_not_found\` listing
the libraries that are selectable.

Omitting \`library\` selects the supported library holding the most tracks,
ties broken by scan order — so an empty local library does not shadow the
populated drive a DJ actually works from. Each library keeps its own search
index, and every query, audit and path resolution stays inside the library
selected for that call; nothing here compares two libraries against each
other.

## Field semantics
- \`Track.key\` is 0..23, \`-1\` means undetermined. The mapping to Camelot
  notation is confirmed against Engine DJ's own display (key=20 shows as 6B,
  exactly what the formula produces). Use \`side.track_derived.camelot\` for
  filtering -- it is indexed. The SQL function \`camelot(key)\` exists but
  runs per row and defeats indexes.
- Real tempo is \`COALESCE(bpmAnalyzed, bpm)\`. \`bpm\` is stored at face
  value -- 102 means 102 BPM, not 10200. It is NOT scaled by 100; that is a
  rekordbox convention, not an Engine one (confirmed against a real Engine
  library: stored values of 102, 105, 128, 145, 147 each matched
  \`bpmAnalyzed\` to within 0.68, and Engine's own interface displays 102 for
  the track stored as 102). \`side.track_derived.tempo\` holds the resolved
  value and is indexed.
- \`Track.rating\` is 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 -- one step per star, measured
  against Engine's own display. The \`rating\` field returns it as stored and
  \`rating_stars\` returns 0..5; the \`rating\` **filter** takes stars. A value
  from other software (ID3's POPM is 0..255) is kept exactly in \`rating\` and
  rounded to the nearest star in \`rating_stars\`.
- \`Track.path\` is relative to the \`Engine Library\` folder and usually
  contains \`..\`. The SQL function \`abs_path(path)\` resolves it against
  this library's location; the home prefix comes back folded to \`~\`.
- \`Track.streamingSource\`, \`uri\` and \`streamingFlags\` are reported to
  decide whether Engine OS streams a track (from Dropbox) instead of reading
  the file. Not measured here: on both reference libraries \`streamingSource\`
  and \`uri\` are NULL on every track, and \`streamingFlags\` is 5 on about
  half of them -- tracks that load and play -- so \`streamingFlags\` on its own
  says nothing about whether a track will load. Selectable as the fields
  \`streaming_source\`, \`streaming_flags\` and \`uri\`; \`uri\` is redacted like
  \`path\`, including a home directory percent-encoded inside it.
- SQLite's \`LOWER()\` folds ASCII only: \`LOWER('ЭЙФОРИЯ')\` comes back
  unchanged. To compare names regardless of case in any script, use
  \`fold(text)\` -- one Unicode normalization form, lower-cased by Unicode
  rules. It runs per row, like every function here.
- \`Track\` carries two Engine triggers. \`trigger_after_update_only_Track_timestamp\`
  sets \`lastEditTime\` (epoch seconds) whenever genre, comment, label, year,
  rating or a dozen other columns are updated -- even to the same value.
  \`trigger_after_update_Track_fix_origin\` fires on ANY update and rewrites an
  empty \`(originDatabaseUuid, originTrackId)\` to this library's uuid and the
  track's own id; in SQLite \`'' = 0\` is false, so a TEXT '' originTrackId does
  not count as empty.
- A track's natural key across drives is \`(originDatabaseUuid, originTrackId)\`.
- \`PerformanceData\`'s blob columns are binary and cannot be read with SQL.
  Engine writes \`quickCues\`, \`loops\`, \`beatData\` and
  \`overviewWaveFormData\` to **every analysed track** whether or not the DJ
  set anything, so \`quickCues IS NOT NULL\` means "analysed", not "has
  cues": a track with no hot cues still carries a full eight-slot blob.
  \`get_track_performance\` decodes one track's blobs; for the whole library,
  \`side.track_derived.has_cues\` below holds the decoded answer.

## Playlists
Order is a **singly linked list**, in both directions of the structure, and
there is no position column anywhere:
- \`Playlist.nextListId\` orders sibling lists within one \`parentListId\`.
- \`PlaylistEntity.nextEntityId\` orders the entries within one \`listId\`.
Both chains terminate at \`0\`.

The schema ships a \`PlaylistPath\` view with a column named \`position\`.
**Do not use it for display order.** Its \`OrderedList\` CTE anchors on
\`WHERE nextListId = 0\` and counts upwards from the *tail*, so ordering by
it yields the sidebar reversed — measured on a real library of 16 playlists,
\`PlaylistPath\` order is exactly the reverse of the chain, and the chain is
what Engine DJ draws. \`get_playlists\` and \`get_playlist_tracks\` walk the
chains; write the same recursive walk if you go via \`run_sql\`, and never
\`ORDER BY id\` — ids happen to agree with the chain until the first time
someone drags a track up a playlist.

Nesting is \`Playlist.parentListId\` (\`0\` at the top level). There is no
folder flag: an Engine folder is just a \`Playlist\` row that other rows
name as their parent. \`Playlist.isPersisted\` marks a list saved to the
device rather than a transient one; both values occur on lists Engine
displays, so nothing is filtered on it. Titles are unique only within a
parent (\`UNIQUE (title, parentListId)\`), so a bare name can match several
playlists — the full \`path\` \`get_playlists\` reports is unique.

\`PlaylistEntity.trackId\` may name a track that is not in this library:
entries outlive their tracks and travel between drives (\`databaseUuid\`
records which library an entry came from). On the reference library 105 of
202 entries are such holes. \`audit_library\`'s \`orphan_entries\` counts
them; \`get_playlist_tracks\` keeps them in place, flagged \`missing\`.

Rule-based **smartlists** live in a separate \`Smartlist\` table, keyed by
uuid with its own \`nextListUuid\` ordering and a JSON \`rules\` column.
Nothing here reads it — a smartlist is not reported by \`get_playlists\`.

## SQL functions
Registered on the query connection, all deterministic:
\`camelot(key)\`, \`key_name(key)\`, \`tempo(bpmAnalyzed, bpm)\`,
\`key_distance(a, b)\` and \`abs_path(path)\`. Each runs a callback per row,
so use them for projection and one-off questions, not in a \`WHERE\` clause
where \`side.track_derived\` is indexed and these are not.

## Sidecar tables
- \`side.fts_track\` — FTS5 over title, artist, album, genre, comment, label,
  with diacritics folded. Join via \`side.fts_map(rowid, track_id)\`.
- \`side.track_derived(track_id, camelot, tempo, has_cues, has_grid)\` — indexed.
  \`has_cues\` is **not** \`quickCues IS NOT NULL\`: the blob is decoded when
  this index is built, and the column means "at least one hot cue is actually
  set". It is the right column for "which tracks have no cues?", and the
  matching \`audit_library\` check is \`no_cues\`. \`has_grid\` does mean "a
  \`beatData\` blob is present and non-empty", which on a real library is the
  same thing as an analysed beatgrid.

## Limits
The connection is read-only at the kernel level, not by convention: writes
are refused by SQLite itself. \`VACUUM\`, \`ATTACH\` and \`DETACH\` are
rejected. Only one statement per call. Queries are killed after 10 seconds.
\`search_tracks\`'s \`total\` (when requested) is capped at 1000; check
\`total_capped\` before treating it as exact.`;
